# Embedded DSL in Typescript
In this README we will explain how to use and/or extend the currently implemented EDSL (Embedded domain specific lanugage).
This implementation is extremely easy to use thanks to the custom VS-Code code snippets which are a core part of making this a productive tool.

## Quick Start
If you only want to use the continuum framework you can simply create a Typescript file and type in one of the predifined code snippets.
NOTE: all configuration need to be in the `DSL/` folder so the file has access to npm dependencies (node modules).
The steps are as follows:
1. Create a `<filename>.ts file` anywhere under the DSL folder. (we recommend makind a dedicated folder so your files don't get mixed with source code files).
2. type in one of the predefined code snippets (to get started we recommend running cfg_basic for a simple working example and refer to the section about it below for a deeper understanding).
3.

The generics folder contains the different variables in the configuration
