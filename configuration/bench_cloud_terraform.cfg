# Benchmark a cloud deployment using gcp
# Google Cloud Platform (GCP) uses Terraform
# When using GCP, special rules apply to this config:
# - Use gcp_cloud/edge/endpoint to select GCP machines for these tiers
# - The cloud/edge/endpoint_cores/_memory fields should reflect the cpu/memory stats of the 
#   GCP machines you selected.
# - The _quota fields won't do anything, but you still have to set them
# - External_physical_machines won't work as we only use the cloud. This is a single host (machine here)
# - Any IP parameter won't work. We let GCP pick it's own IPs.
